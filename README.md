# CS-305-Software-Security
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
-Artemis Financial creates unique financial strategies for its clients. The financial plans cover retirement, investments, insurance, and savings. To maintain secure interactions, Artemis Financial wishes to add a file verification step to their web application. They will require a data verification step in the form of a checksum when the web application is used to send data. To satisfy their software security needs, I have taken their current software application and integrated secure communication components.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
-I have located and addressed many of Artemis Financial's secure coding issues. The security of Artemis' application source code is crucial because their business handles and stores financial data. The foundation of the company's reputation is trust, and building that starts with putting the right security measures in place—including in the source code.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
-One of the most challenging aspects of the project was identifying potential vulnerabilities in the application code.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
-I have increased layers of security by incorporating an SSL or secure socket layer. I have also added access control and the use of a CA certificate.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
-I ran an OWASP dependency check to ensure that I did not introduce new vulnerabilities into the code.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
-Checksum generation
-Dependency checks
-CA certificates
-secure socket layers

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
-The second project displays many of the lessons and practices that I have learned in this class.
